--
-- With the exception of complex numbers -- 'Complex' depends upon 'RealFloat'
-- -- asanova lacks obvious support for floating-point numbers because
-- floating-point arithmetic is imprecise, accumulates errors, and can mislead. 
-- Instead, Casanova uses arbitrary-precision ratios and a dedicated value for
-- infinity.  The properties of floating-point arithmetic enable the direct
-- translation of floating-point values, so nothing is really lost.
